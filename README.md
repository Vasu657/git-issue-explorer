## ❤️ The Heart of the Project

### Why I Built This
Every developer remembers the first time they felt "stuck." Not stuck on a bug, but stuck on the outside looking in. GitHub is the world's largest library of human knowledge, yet its native interface for finding entry-level issues can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Labels are fragmented, repositories are vast, and the barrier to entry often isn't the code—it's the discovery.

**I built GitFinder because I believe no developer should be sidelined by a search bar.** 

This project is a love letter to the open-source community. It’s for the maintainer who wants their "good first issues" to find the right eyes, and for the beginner developer who is one "fixed typo" away from feeling like they belong in this ecosystem.
